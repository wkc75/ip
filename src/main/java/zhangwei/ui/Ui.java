/**
 * Deals with everything the user sees and types: it reads commands from the
 * console and prints the chatbot's replies.
 *
 * <p>
 * Collecting the console work here means the rest of the program never
 * calls {@code System.out} directly, so the wording of a message can be
 * changed, or the whole console replaced with a window, without touching the
 * classes that decide what to say.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every line is written twice: once to the console, and once to an internal
 * buffer that {@link #drainOutput()} hands over. The console version of the
 * chatbot ignores the buffer, while the graphical version reads it instead of
 * the console, so both front ends get the same words from the same code.
