 * Entry point of ZhangWei, a chatbot that keeps track of the user's tasks.

 * <p>This class only wires the other classes together and runs the command
 * loop: the {@link Ui} talks to the user, the {@link Parser} makes sense of
 * what was typed, each {@link Command} carries one instruction out, the
 * {@link TaskList} holds the tasks and the {@link Storage} keeps them on disk.
 *
 * <p>It offers two ways in. {@link #run()} drives the console version, reading
 * one line at a time until the user says bye. {@link #getResponse(String)}
 * answers one line and returns what would have been printed, which is what the
 * graphical version calls each time the user presses Send.
